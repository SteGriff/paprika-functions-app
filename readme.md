# Paprika Functions App

This is a WIP attempt to host [Paprika.Net][paprikanet] in an Azure Functions App so that it can be stateless and serverless.

For some design principles and API, please see [`/docs/api.md`][api]

[paprikanet]: https://github.com/stegriff/paprika.net
[api]: /docs/api.md

## To do

[ ] Release Paprika.Net v1.1 on GitHub
[ ] Publish v1.1 as a NuGet package
[ ] Update my VS2017 to 17.4
[ ] Download Azure workload update with project template for Functions App
[ ] Start Functions App and import NuGet package
[ ] Then all we have to is write it ;)

## Aims

Minimum viable product working in Dec 2017
